Getting Started
===============

Scope
-----

SmartSnippets\ |trade| Toolbox is provided with the Development Kit of Renesas's Bluetooth chipset. 
It is targeting the main activities of programming and optimizing code for best power performance. It enables:

#. programming the OTP and Flash memories with the actual application compiled image
#. accurate examination of the power profile and how it is affected by application software
#. downloading a SW image to SRAM and execute
	
The SmartSnippets\ |trade| Toolbox makes maximum use of the available features on the motherboard and 
thus allowing developers of Bluetooth smart applications to work without expensive and bulky equipment. 
The tool will provide full visibility on the chip activity, which is crucial in developing ultra low power wireless applications.


Work Flow
---------

This section is providing a guide to start using the SmartSnippets\ |trade| Toolbox, a proposed way of working with the 
tools available for the basic tasks during development.
The following figure illustrates the basic flow to run a program from OTP on a DA1453x and DA14585/6 family chip.

   Develop and run a program from OTP for DA1453x, DA14585/6

*[1] Renesas's Development Board needs no configuration*

*[2] From this point on, application development and debugging is done, and OTP will be programmed*

The user might experiment with the Power Profiler for optimizing the code as much as possible. 
This can take several iterations since the user can insert SW cursors (see :ref:`cursors` ) to 
identify the code executions translated into current dissipation. As soon as it is completed, 
the programming of the code into the OTP might start so that the system is self-sustained. 
Upon OTP burning, the system can operate on a battery and realize complete power cycles 
e.g. active and sleep intervals. Please refer to :ref:`power_profiler` about a detailed description of Power Profiler.



Device Selection
----------------

The first time SmartSnippets\ |trade| Toolbox is launched on a clean workspace the user will see the following:

.. _targetSelection:
.. figure:: images/targetSelection.png
   :align: center
   
   Application window when device is unknown
   
At this point the target device is still unknown. No tools will be available until a device is selected or detected. 
The application has been launched with a default project (named 'Default') at which user settings will be saved. 
User can either use this default project or create a new project using the *Project* menu. 
Then the user is advised to either select *Detect Device* from the *Board Menu* or to manually select the device 
and the interfaces to be used from the *Board Menu*.  Once a device is detected or manually selected the groups of 
tools supported for this device will be loaded at the ribbon.

SmartSnippets\ |trade| Toolbox saves user configurations (selected device, communication interfaces, tool specific settings) 
at the active project. If there any unsaved changes on application exit or when user switches to another project the user 
will be asked to save these changes. SmartSnippets\ |trade| Toolbox remembers the project that has been used in 
the last session and it will load by default the same project the next time the application is launched. 
   
   
UART Port Configuration
-----------------------

If the connection between SmartSnippets\ |trade| and the board over the UART link is unstable try to change the 
latency time of the FTDI cable and set to some value below 10ms. User can configure the latency from the Device Manager. 
To open the Device Manager in Windows 10, the user can press the Windows button and type *Device Manager* in the search box. 
From the Device Manager expand Ports (COM & LPT). Right click on preferred port, click properties, select tab 
Port Settings and then advanced. In windows 8 COM & LPT is hidden. Go to View and select Show hidden devices. 
At :numref:`advanced-com-settings` you can see a screenshot of example settings.
