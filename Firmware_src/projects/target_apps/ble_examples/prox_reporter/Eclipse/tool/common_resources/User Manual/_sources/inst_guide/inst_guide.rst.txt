Installation Guide
##################

Windows
*******

#. SmartSnippets\ |trade| Toolbox supports 64-bit environments. SmartSnippets\ |trade| Studio installer contains SmartSnippets\ |trade| Toolbox application.
#. To use FTDI devices, the appropriate FTDI drivers need to be installed on the system. Just use the standard Windows ``New hardware has been found`` wizard to install them.
#. To use a Bluetooth dongle, the appropriate JLINK drivers need to be installed on the system. The latest drivers can be found at http://www.segger.com/jlink-software.html. To download them, please click on the ``Download`` button under the ``J-Link software & documentation pack for Windows`` section. While installing these drivers, it is recommended that the Bluetooth dongle is NOT connected to the USB port.
#. If an error occurs while using the SPotA tool and trying to connect to the Bluetooth dongle, please make sure that the ``Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package`` libraries are installed at ``C:\\Windows\\System32`` folder. Otherwise, please download and install the latest Redistributable libraries for Visual Studio 2010 from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2019667/.
#. If the following error dialog appears, Java Simple Serial Connector library (JSSC), which is used by SmartSnippets\ |trade| Toolbox for serial communication, 
   could not be loaded successfully. The reason is that none of the user home folder and user Temp folder is writable. 
   JSSC library extracts to user home folder (or user Temp folder, if user home folder is not writable) the required DLLs for serial connection. 
   The user can change the access rights of these folders or overwrite the default user folder location. In order to overwrite the default user 
   home path, the user can use USER_HOME property. For example the user can set 
   ``USER_HOME=C:/Users/_username_`` or ``USER_HOME=C:\\Users\\_username_`` at the properties file. 
   File ``properties.txt`` is inside SmartSnippets\ |trade| Toolbox workspace folder.

Linux Support
*************

Changing device permissions
===========================

When user adds a development board on a Linux system, new devices are created automatically on the OS. These devices should have read and write permission for all users. To avoid setting appropriate permissions every time SmartSnippets\ |trade| Toolbox is used, a rules file is provided which changes permissions to every "known" FTDI device. The file, named  smartsnippets_studio_common_ftdi_devices.rules, contains a list of common vendor and product IDs and should be placed under /etc/udev/rules.d. If the user cannot find the VID-PID pair of the board used under this list, it is recommended that a new .rules file is created and copied to /etc/udev/rules.d folder.


Setting VID-PID pairs for Power Profiler
========================================

Except from changing permissions of connected devices, as described in the previous section, the user should also add the VID-PID pairs to the SmartSnippets\ |trade| Toolbox properties file, in order to work with Power Profiler.
Due to incompatibility with FTDI Linux kernel module, SmartSnippets\ |trade| Toolbox needs to know the Vendor and Product ID of the connected devices, in order to unload FTDI kernel module, before using ftd2xx library.
Power Profiler works with a default VID-PID pair: VID= 0x0403 and PID=0x6010. User can add extra VID-PID pairs in properties.txt file in the following way:

VID.1.0=0x0405
   
PID.1.0=0x6011

VID.Dialog_1468xAD=0x0406
   
PID.Dialog_1468xAD=0x6012

VID-PID pairs are created from properties starting with VID. (or vid.) and PID. (or pid.) and having common text after the first '.'.
