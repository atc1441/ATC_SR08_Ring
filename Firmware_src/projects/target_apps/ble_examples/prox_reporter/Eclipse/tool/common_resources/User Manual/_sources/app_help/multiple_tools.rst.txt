Working with multiple tools
---------------------------

.. include:: <isonum.txt>

SmartSnippets\ |trade| Toolbox has been designed to help user achieve maximum productivity by allowing multiple tools be displayed on the screen at the same time. When working with multiple tools, user can:

#. Modify the size of each tool frame
#. Determine the exact location of each tool frame, by dragging the tool frame title bar and placing it at the upper, lower, left or right side of another tool frame
#. Stack and un-stack tool frames, by dragging the tool frame title bar and placing it at the center of another tool frame
#. Minimize a tool frame. User can make it visible again by clicking on the corresponding left-hand side toolbox button
#. Maximize a tool frame and restore it to its previous size and location

.. note::

	 The tools provided by the framework depend on chip version selection.

  
Every time the user closes the application, all view layout-related data is stored and restored next time the application starts. To restore view layout to default, user can press the |layout| button located under the *Workspace* group of the ribbon toolbar.
