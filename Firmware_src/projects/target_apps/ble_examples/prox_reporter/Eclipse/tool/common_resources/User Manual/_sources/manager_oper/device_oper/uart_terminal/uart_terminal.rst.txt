UART Terminal
=============

This is considered as an advanced tool. Enable it from menu *Settings -> Advanced Settings*.

UART Terminal is available only for connection over UART.
After successfully downloading the selected file to the chip, the 'Start Terminal' 
button is activated and the user can press it in order to receive data from UART. 
While the connection to the UART is open, the user cannot open a second UART connection 
and for this reason the 'Connect' buttons of other tool pages are disabled. The 
user has to press the 'Stop Terminal' button in order to close the UART connection. 
At any point, the user can press the 'Settings' or 'Clear' buttons. Trough the 
'Settings' button users can configure UART port settings, for more information 
please see :ref:`UARTConnection`. To clean up the area where data 
received from the UART is displayed, users can press on *Clear* button.
